# iMessage-Quine
A Python Quine that outputs it's entire source code over iMessage

## To Send a Message
(Will only work with MacOS as it uses applescript to send the message.)

Save the iMessage-Quine.py file locally.

Change the phone_number variable currently set to 'XXXXXXXXX' to a string with the phone number or icloud contact of whoever you want to receive the iMessage.
(Remember to do this in both locations so that the message remains a quine.)

Run the python file.
